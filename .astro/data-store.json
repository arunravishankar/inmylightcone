If you've somehow stumbled upon this corner of the internet, welcome. I'm Arun, a former theoretical physicist who spent my PhD days studying the stability of black holes before finding myself in the world of two-sided marketplaces.\n\nThis blog is my thinking-out-loud space—a place to explore ideas, connect dots between different fields, and hopefully meet some interesting people along the way.\n\n## What You'll Find Here\n\nI've always been drawn to understanding complex systems through mathematical frameworks. While my professional journey has taken me away from theoretical physics, my fascination with finding patterns in seemingly chaotic interactions remains. Here's a glimpse of some of the things I want to explore in this space:\n\n### Bayesian Experimentation\n\nOne topic I'm eager to dive into is Bayesian approaches to experimentation. After years of running experiments in marketplace settings, I've developed an intuition about when and why different methodologies of analyzing experimental results make sense in business contexts. \n\nMost data scientists are familiar with frequentist approaches, but there are compelling reasons to consider Bayesian frameworks in certain situations. I want to explore questions like:\n\n* When does a Bayesian approach provide meaningful advantages?\n* How do you communicate Bayesian results to stakeholders used to p-values and confidence intervals?\n* What are the practical implementation challenges in business settings?\n\n### Optimal Play in Games\n\nI've developed a bit of an obsession with game theory and optimal play strategies. There's fascinating math behind why people do what they do when they're competing or cooperating.\n\nFor instance, I'm very interested in training a bot to play the game of \\[Quoridor]\\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor)). Like chess, Quoridor is a complete information, deterministic game, so methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search and approaches similar to \\[AlphaZero]\\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero)) should work well.\n\nBut what about incomplete information and stochastic games like Poker? How do you formulate optimal play when you don't have perfect information? I want to explore the whole spectrum of game types and think about approaches to learning optimal play in each context.\n\n### Auction Theory\n\nAuctions are fascinating mechanisms where game theory, economics, and psychology intersect. While I haven't spent too much time yet thinking about specifics, I'd love to write a series on auction designs and decision-making in auction environments.\n\nFrom simple English auctions to complex combinatorial auctions, there's rich territory to explore around optimality, efficiency, and strategy.\n\n### Reinforcement Learning Applications\n\nI'm also interested in exploring fields where reinforcement learning frameworks can be helpful. There are obvious applications like continuous games and self-driving vehicles, but I suspect there are many less obvious domains where viewing problems through this lens could be surprisingly useful.\n\n## An Invitation\n\nIf any of these topics resonate with you, I'd love to hear from you. My real hope for this blog is to find others who get equally excited about these intersections—so if anything here sparks your interest, please reach out!\n\nWhat you'll find here is whatever's bouncing around in my head at the moment—definitely not a complete picture of everything I care about, just the current edition of \"things I can't stop thinking about.\"","posts/arun-first-post.md","eb6c7d0700f332c9",{"html":65,"metadata":66},"\u003Ch1 id=\"welcome-to-my-lightcone\">Welcome to My Lightcone\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Hi there!
