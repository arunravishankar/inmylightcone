In physics, a lightcone represents the path that light (or any causal influence) can take through spacetime from a specific event. It defines the boundary between what can and cannot affect that eventâ€”or be affected by it. Everything inside your past lightcone has potentially shaped your present, while everything in your future lightcone can potentially be influenced by your actions now.

I named this blog "In my Lightcone" because it represents the range of ideas and topics that have shaped my thinking and those I hope to explore and share. It's my small corner of the internet where I can connect dots between different fields through mathematics and computation.

I'm drawn to finding mathematical patterns in complex systems. Math gives us tools to make sense of phenomena in nature, whether they're in physics, economics, biology, or society. This blog is where I'll share what I'm learning.

I hope to use this as my journal of ideas which allows me to be more rigorous in exploring topics of interest, as well as putting it out there so that it sparks interest in like-minded people allowing for an exchange of ideas through conversation.
