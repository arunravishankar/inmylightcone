Former theoretical physicist who studied the stability of black holes for my PhD before stumbling into the world of two-sided marketplaces. Since then, I've found myself drawn into exploring experimentation, and the fascinating complexity that emerges when decision-making agents interact in markets. I've also become  interested in data pipelines and MLOps—something I'd never have appreciated during my PhD days but now recognize how thoughtful infrastructure design can dramatically transform both daily work experiences and broader business outcomes.

I've developed a bit of an obsession with games, optimal play strategies, and auction mechanisms—turns out there's fascinating math behind why people do what they do when they're competing or cooperating.

This blog is basically my thinking-out-loud space. I'm connecting dots between different fields using math and code, and sharing what I'm learning along the way. My real hope is to find others who get equally excited about these intersections—so if anything here sparks your interest, please reach out! I'm always up for conversations that push these ideas further.

When I'm not down these rabbit holes, I'm probably in my kitchen getting creative with vegan cooking.

What you'll find here is whatever's bouncing around in my head at the moment—definitely not a complete picture of everything I care about, just the current edition of 'things I can't stop thinking about.'
